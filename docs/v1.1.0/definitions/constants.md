## Constant Properties

This type of property is set at creation and never changes.

- It requires 2 rules:

  - **`constant`** which must be **`true`** and
  - **`value`** which is either a **`fixed value`** or a setter (sync/async function which returns generated value)

- The `onDelete` & `onSuccess` are the only life cycle handlers supported on constant properties.
  These handlers would run once for when creating an instance ('onSuccess') and one more time when 'onDelete'

Example:

```ts
import { Schema, type Context } from 'ivo';

type Input = {
  userName: string;
};

type Output = {
  dateJoined: Date;
  id: string;
  role: string;
};

type Ctx = Context<Input, Output>;

const userSchema = new Schema<Input, Output>({
  dateJoined: { constant: true, value: () => new Date() },
  id: {
    constant: true,
    value: (ctx: Ctx) => `${ctx.userName}-${Date.now}`, // ⚠️ ctx is possibly not safe because it runs before values get validated
  },
  role: { constant: true, value: 'user' },
  userName: { required: true, validator: validateUserName },
});
```

> N.B: if the value of a constant is to be generated by a function and this function happens to throw an error, the value of the constant will be `null`
